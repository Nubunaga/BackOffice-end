/**
 * The class <em>PlayedVideo</em> is the service class that handles the lookup
 * for the played database and also modifies the data to be returned back to the
 * call√© to use the <em>played video lists </em>. It has dependencies with the
 * Advertisment_video class,
 * 
 * @see com.example.demos.model.Advertisment_video.java. This class is used to
 *      display all the videos played as a list. This class also has
 *      dependencies with the class <em> <Instert repository here> </em>
 * @see com.example.demos.repository.<Instert repository here> that implements
 *      the crud repository and speciallised method to call for all the played
 *      video of a specific order.
 * 
 * 
 *      This class implements methods <code>{@link#<insert>}</code> to retrive
 *      the list from the database and with the help of helperclasses <insert
 *      here> transforms the data into a json format to add to the list and
 *      return to the caller. It will show if the video is playing live
 *      depending on if the epoch time is not outside the given second length
 *      that is provided with each video.
